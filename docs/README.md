# Readme

Just my personal site, recording some daily works, possibly code pieces, or some short tutorials, if I have time. If you like it, that's my pleasure. My apologies for my bad English.
The theme used is produced by [Huxpro(黄玄)][1] , the site is hosted on github and created using [Jekyll][2].

My change to the original work is shwn as listed:

- Adding share bar at the bottom
- Use random pictures provided by [Unsplash][5] for the background.
- Use archives (copied from [BruceZhao's work][6]) instead of tags.
- Use monokai for code syntax highlighting (Using work from [richleland][7]).
- Removed some content not needed.
